# EO-Flashcards
A Simple Flashcard based game for learning Esperanto.
This is designed and made for my Year 12 Software Development Task.

Coded in Visual Basic, using Microsoft Visual Studio (urgh).

I've got to ask kindly that the code for this is not made public until I've finished it, and after the DUE Date of the Task.

\#linuxmasterrace @ snoonet.org (More specifically, iownall555, from linuxmasterrace who made the python script to seperate the english and esperanto)

## Installation
The program is built for .Net Framework 4.5.2, you'll probably need that to run.

Download the latest release from the [releases section](https://github.com/AConsolePeasant/EO-Flashcards/releases)

Then extract the zip file to your desktop, and run setup.exe. This will install and automatically open the program. You will be able to run the program from your start menu.
