# EO-Flashcards

EO-Flashcards is a simple flashcard game to help with the learning of Esperanto (and hopefully other langauges).
The program was made for AConsolePeasant's Year 12 programming task, and coded in Visual Basic.

## Installation
The program is built for .Net Framework 4.5.2, you'll probably need that to run.

Download the latest release from the [releases section](https://github.com/AConsolePeasant/EO-Flashcards/releases)

Then extract the zip file to your desktop, and run setup.exe. This will install and automatically open the program. You will be able to run the program from your start menu.
