# EO-Flashcards
A Simple Flashcard based game for learning Esperanto.
This is designed and made for my Year 12 Software Development Task.

Coded in Visual Basic, using Microsoft Visual Studio (urgh).

I've got to ask kindly that the code for this is not made public until I've finished it, and after the DUE Date of the Task.
